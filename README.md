## Hey There

My name is Alex and I'm a computer science student at the University Of Western Ontario. I've been in love with computers in general since I was ten. Since then I've been learning as much as I can about computer science and the innerworkings of all things digital.
I'm hoping to finish my studies to then pursue a masters or even Phd in CS. My main interests are in systems and graphics programing.
